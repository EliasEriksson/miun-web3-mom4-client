## About
This website is a way to interact with the REST webservice hosted at https://web3mom5.eliaseriksson.eu/ 
([repo](https://github.com/EliasEriksson/miun-web3-mom5-rest)). It allows a user to read
a list of courses and add to them. An account have to be manually added by a site admin to allow access.



## Run the client locally
1. Install typescript if it is not globally installed. `npm install`.
2. Run `tsc`.
3. Compile the Sass files using `sass src/sass/main.scss public/css/main.css`.
4. Open `public/` in a dev server.
